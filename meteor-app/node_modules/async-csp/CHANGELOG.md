# Change Log

## 0.5.0 (2016-04-17)

### Added

- `Channel.pipeline()` can accept a `Channel` directly. ([efbb0a5](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/efbb0a5cd0d2033dca530c999bf389da2704aded))

- `Channel#pipe()` can accept a `Function` directly. ([afa1e70](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/afa1e70deff3fd2de0f5d90632d146d6969893fe))

- `Channel` is now exposed as both named and default. ([fc2d063](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/fc2d063a803dea11cbe571191bd775d78fca6310))

- Added umd output in `dist`. ([d7640c1](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/d7640c156fdb83432772cda2729061c0bbf44dbd), [4728a52](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/4728a522e6a21118b0e94dad575947c3eb563bab))

## 0.4.0 (2016-03-27)

### Changed

- Using Babel v6 to build the dist files ([1b9ca7d])(https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/1b9ca7d7d4b740544e0d812a163087d3d6b2b321)

## 0.3.0 (2015-11-21)

### Changed

- **(BREAKING)** `Channel` is no longer buffered by default. To make a buffered `Channel`, you must pass a size into the constructor. ([c17ddb8](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/c17ddb8954090d655c2b20790fb4dc07d4d985f5))

### Added

- `Channel.pipeline()` can now accept an array of functions to make a set of piped `Channel`s. ([45656df](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/45656df827f8df589f947bd7f67054674dc19d6c))

## 0.2.2 (2015-09-28)

### Added

- Added `Channel#tail()`. ([6058027](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/605802764bd7f2498a7ef97dce27f8f4041ec846))

## 0.2.1 (2015-07-25)

### Changed

- Performance improvements with `Channel#consume()`. ([5d2f9e9](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/5d2f9e9b1d759d84f3e9f3fe57ced5c37a519def))

## 0.2.0 (2015-07-25)

### Changed

- `Channel.from()` will now set the size of the returned `Channel` to the size of the original iterable. ([4a712bf](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/4a712bf8c8dd66aeb0ae41afe083633dbe598c34))

### Added

- Added support for asynchronous `Channel` transforms. ([15b0eb0](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/15b0eb09e84b26cd8a73b96eb1fd4638b4287dc3), [4a712bf](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/4a712bf8c8dd66aeb0ae41afe083633dbe598c34))

### Fixed

- `Channel#consume()` will no longer trigger a `Channel#close()` until the final consume callback has been settled. This means the general flow should still be the same, but any instances of `Channel#done()` should wait to resolve until `Channel#consume()` is done working. ([da66c61](https://github.com/dvlsg/async-csp/commit/da66c61e954caad58bbd62a68c11b43216859db7))

## 0.1.0 (2015-06-27)

### Added

- Initial commit for all `Channel` code.
