                IPL (the Information Processing Language) is believed to be the
                first functional computer programming language, created by
                Allen Newel, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon at the RAND
                Corporation and at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in
                1956. The motivation behind IPL was to create a language with
                the ability to manipulate lists and and to support functions
                that could take other functions as arguments (i.e. lambda
                functions). IPL was an assembly-like language.

                Shortly after, in 1958, John McCarthy began working on the
                language known as Lisp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                The motivation behind Lisp was to create a higher level (i.e.
                not assembly-like) language that was good for developing
                artificial intelligence.  Lisp is a list processing language,
                as a list processing language seemed appropriate for
                programming the operations involved with deduction. Lisp also
                supports lambda functions. Languages like Scheme have been inspired by Lisp.

                Today, Haskell is a popular functional programming language
                that has been in constant development since 1987, with it's
                first version being released in 1990. The motive behind Haskell
                was to create an publicly open standard for functional
                programming languages. It is one of the most modern functional
                programming language that is still being developed.
